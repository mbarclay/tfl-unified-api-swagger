# Tfl Unified API Swagger Specification

Please note: TfL now publish a [Swagger Specification](https://api.tfl.gov.uk/  "Official TfL API Swagger Specification") of their API.

A swagger 2.0 specification for the unified TfL developer API [api.tfl.gov.uk](https://api.tfl.gov.uk/  "Transport for London Unified API")

The initial production of this specification was kindly provided by TfL using Swashbuckle against their Microsoft .NET WebAPI.

The specification has since undergone a couple of manual clean-ups; as is the nature of evolving API's there maybe some end points missing. The `/Notification` and `/AirQuality` endpoints are not presently included in this specification.
